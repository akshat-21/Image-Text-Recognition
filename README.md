# Image Text Recognition

Used Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine for recognition of text from images.

The file **`grayscale.py`** is to convert the image to grayscale and **`blacknwhite.py`** is to convert image to image with white background. Used these for preprocessing of images to optimize results of Tesseract OCR.
